## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Performance Improvements**:
   - JSON source generation for faster serialization
   - Output caching for reduced server load
   - EF Core 8 performance optimizations

2. **Developer Experience**:
   - Improved type safety with nullable reference types
   - Better API documentation with response type attributes
   - TypedResults for clearer controller return types

3. **Modern Features**:
   - Latest ASP.NET Core middleware
   - Advanced caching capabilities
   - Updated dependency injection patterns

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Thoroughly test the application to ensure all functionality works as expected
2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Compare performance metrics before and after migration
3. **Consider Additional .NET 8 Features**:
   - Native AOT compilation for improved startup time
   - Minimal API endpoints for simpler endpoints
   - Rate limiting for API protection
